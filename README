constant::lexical, version 2.0001

This module creates constants in the manner of constant.pm, but
deletes them when the enclosing scope finishes compiling.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

•‘use constant::lexical’ with no arguments now works. (Oops!)  Thanks
  to Neil Bowers for reporting this (RT #73694).
• String evals no longer stop constants from going out  of  scope  in
  perl 5.10.x.


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install constant::lexical"

    [sudo] cpan constant::lexical

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires perl 5.8.0 or later and the Sub::Delete module.


DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for these modules with
the perldoc command.

    perldoc constant::lexical

Or try using man (it's faster, in my experience):

    man constant::lexical
