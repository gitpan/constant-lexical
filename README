constant::lexical, version 2

This module creates constants in the manner of constant.pm, but
deletes them when the enclosing scope finishes compiling.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

True lexical constants for perl 5.11.2 and higher


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install constant::lexical"

    [sudo] cpan constant::lexical

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install


DEPENDENCIES

DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for these modules with
the perldoc command.

    perldoc constant::lexical

Or try using man (it's faster, in my experience):

    man constant::lexical
